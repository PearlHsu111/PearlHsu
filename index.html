        <p class="lead mb-4">  My passion for business can be traced back to high school as an art admissions team finance. That is where I manage the NAHS (National Art Honor Society) events including the day of the dead campus decoration, art show with art history, drawing/painting, Ceramics and Digital/Photography display, and Christmas art sale. I enjoy encouraging new people to the art society, and I was heavily engaged in the AP 3D art program since I was taking 3D design at the time. Managing large events trained my ability on budget managing and event planning skills. I was able to interact with more people with different backgrounds, and recruit people with the same passion. I also joined the robotics team as a mechanical building member for all four years of high school and manage to promote and expend team funding with Christmas sales and daily food cart sales. I learned how to manage the funds for parts that our robot need. <br><br>

          Outside of class, I also do a lot of different volunteer work. My obliging personality in serving communities is my greatest passion. Building connections between people and help in guiding people who are in need is always my goal. I deeply enjoy soundness and sense of accomplishment by helping others while making myself a better person and protecting the environment simultaneously. I have shown my enthusiasm in different ways throughout my life. I worked as a teacher assistant with my homestay mom Mrs. Angie at Hero Elementary school. Every Saturday, I go help with the preparation and set up the equipment that will be used for Saturday School, then check-in the children when school starts. Throughout the day, I would help and support teachers and accompany children who need special attention and care in order to help them in their education. I enjoy helping Children and assist in the education to others. I also worked with different homeless shelters in Santa Ana back in high school where I cook and manage resources like clothing and used books, furnitures to people who are in need but couldn’t afford the money. I get to learn how to social and managing of human resources. 
        <br><br>

        	I am currently a freshman in University of California, Riverside, and I am one of the Outreach Committee member of FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America). Therefor I need to do tabling in the campus and try to recruit more people who are interested in the club. I also planned FBLA social events like FBLA week, boba social, and FBLA scavenger hunt. All of these events are to help new members to know each other more by having fun events throughout the week. I manage to help and support my team to get points, and make sure everyone’s having a good time. I am able to plan on big professional events like resume workshop and Linkedin set up workshop for club members to learn. I get to learn how to manage a team, write a professional budget sheet, and so many business related works.
